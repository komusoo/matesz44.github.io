## Description
> My houseplant and I were working on a biology assignment together. Yes, my houseplant. Don't question it. Anyways, she ended up giving me a new cipher to use in my next project! So I'm giving it to my biology friends to see if they can solve it. They are, after all, studying DNA and mRNA right now.  
> `AUGCAAGGUCUCUUGACCCAGUGGAUACUAAAUGCCUGGAAGGUAGCAUACUAG`  
> `Key: 6, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 8, 3, 3, 2, 7, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1`

## Hints
> Make sure to encase the plaintext with `rtcp{}` Spaces are represented by a underscore, (_)

# Start
- It's an **RNA** chain  
![codons-dna](codons-dna.png)
- We have to decrypt the long string with the image we found.
- Key numbers are the `n`-th character in the name of the whole *base*  
For example `UUU` is Phenylalanine and the key is `11` we get `i`.
- Decrypt the whole string with this technique and get the flag
- **DONT** include the ones that has `start` or `stop` in the name  

My manual decryption:
