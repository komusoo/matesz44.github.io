# Lets start
- Sunday = 0
- Saturday = 6
- `Hump's Day` is *Wednesday* = 3
- `TGIF` is *Friday* = 5

## Converting the days to numbers
If we correctly convert it we have to get `3563531888962843501`. Now we have to convert it to hex then string as the hint says.  
Just search for a [decimal to hex converter](https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter) and paste the number.

And we have the hex `3174355F6368336D`.  
Now we have to convert it to text with a [hex to text converter](https://www.duplichecker.com/hex-to-text.php).  
![hex2text](hex2text.png)  
And we got the flag text `1t5_ch3m`

# G07 17 4YYYYY
```
rtcp{1t5_ch3m}
```
