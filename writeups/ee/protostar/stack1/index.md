```c

```
**It needs an input**
And we can see in the source the max is `64` *characters*.

## Fuzzin it

So we enter 64 `A` and see what happens( protip: open python and type `print 'A'*64` -> copy and paste ).

Now enter 65!
- We got `you have changed the 'modified' variable`.
## OH boiiii we got it (:
